# Fake Curriculum

Here you can see a fake curriculum forked from [Jorge Lopez](@jorloque), who was
my teacher of `Developing Environment` and `Web Applications Deployment`.

## Dual Deployment

This fake curriculum is deployed on GitHub Pages. However, it is deployed on AWS
using S3 with Static Site Hosting enabled.

### GitHub Pages

When I made a change on `main` branch, a deployment workflow is called using my
own
[Minify Composite Action](https://github.com/pabcrudel/static-site-optimizer).

```yml
# .github/workflows/gh-pages-deployment.yml

name: GitHub Pages Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  ci-cd:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Minify & Deploy
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout files
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Minify html, css and js files
        uses: pabcrudel/static-site-optimizer@main
        with:
          project_path: .

      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4.4.3
        with:
          folder: dist
```

### AWS S3 Hosting Bucket

This feature is being performed by the AWS Console of an AWS Academy Lab, so is
offline.
